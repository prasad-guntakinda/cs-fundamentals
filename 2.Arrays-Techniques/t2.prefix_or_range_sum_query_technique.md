# Range Sum Query:
##### Revision-1=================
- The range sum query technique is a method for answering queries that ask for the sum of a range of elements in an array.
- The basic idea behind the range sum query technique is to precompute the sum of all the elements in the array.
- This can be done by creating a prefix sum array, which is an array where the ith element is equal to the sum of all the elements in the array from index 0 to index i.
- `prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[0]+ prefixSum[1]+ .....+ prefixSum[i-1] + prefixSum[i]`

### How to calculate range_sum from prefix sum array?

- Once the prefix sum array has been created, answering a range sum query is very simple.
- To answer a query that asks for the sum of the elements in the range from index 'L' to index 'R', 
- range sum[L, R]:
  
        - If L==0 then range sum = prefixSum[R]
        - Otherwise,
        - we simply subtract the sum of the elements in the range from index 0 to index L-1 from the sum of the elements in the range from index 0 to index R.
        - rangeSum[L,R] = prefixSum[R]-prefixSum[L-1]


- It can be used to:

        - Respond to range-sum-queries and range-xor-queries
        - Find sum of all elements in a given range
        - Locate subarrays having the highest sum
        - Locate the subarray whose total is closest to a given value
        - Locate subarrays of two arrays that are the same length and sum
        - Simulate parallel algorithms

#### Example:
- Let us take cricket score board example

### How to create a Prefix Sum Array?

```java
     int[] input = {1,5,3,4,6,7,10};
     int[] prefixSum = new int[input.length];
     for(int i=0; i< input.length; i++){
            if(i==0)
                prefixSum[i] = input[i];
            else
                prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + input[i];
        }
```
- Remember this: `prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[0]+ prefixSum[1]+ .....+ prefixSum[i-1]+prefixSum[i]`
- as part of cumulative sum if you want ot find the sum of `ith` element you can directly add `ith` value to previous sum  `prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + input[i]`
