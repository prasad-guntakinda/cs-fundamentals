# two-pointer technique
###### Revision-1 ========================
- The two pointer technique is a pattern in which two pointers iterate across the data structure until one or both of them satisfy the necessary condition.
- **Suitable Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists

#### common patterns in the two-pointer approach:
            
##### 1. One pointer starts from beginning and other starts from end, they move toward each other until they both meet.
**Example Problems:**
1. Reverse the characters in a string
2. Reverse An Array or Part of an array
3. Rotate Array K times


##### 2. One pointer moves at a slow pace while the other pointer moves at a faster pace.
**Example Problems:**

- remove duplicates from a sorted array
- 

## When to Use ?
1. Whenever problem involves with reverse or rotation
2. Whenever you are looping through array multiple times
3. Middle element in the linked list
4. 


#### Classic problems:

1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
2. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
3. Reverse Words in a String II
4. Rotate Array
5. Valid Palindrome
6. Container With Most Water
7. Product of Array Except Self
