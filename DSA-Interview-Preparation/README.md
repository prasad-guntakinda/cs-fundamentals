# DSA Interview Preparation:


## DSA Problem Solving Steps:

1. Understand the Given Problem Identify Given, Expected
2. Go Through Examples to cover Edge Cases and ask questions to understand the problem statement
3. Think of Brute-Force Solution
4. Draw some Observations from Brute-Force and Identify Patterns or Optimization approach
5. Write Optimized Code with TC and SC


        - Given
        - Expected
        - Examples
        - Brute-Force
        - Observations
        - Optimize
        - TC & SC
