# Linked List Interview Preparation Guide

## Key Concepts to Learn
- Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List
- Node structure and pointer manipulation
- Traversal, insertion, deletion (at head, tail, kth position)
- Finding middle node (slow/fast pointer)
- Reversal of linked list (iterative and recursive)
- Detecting and removing cycles (Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare)
- Merging two sorted linked lists
- Intersection of two linked lists
- Palindrome check in linked list
- Copying a linked list with random pointers
- Sorting a linked list (merge sort)
- Linked list as stack/queue implementation
- Implement LRU cache using linked list

## Patterns to Master
- Two-pointer (slow/fast, runner technique)
- Recursion for list manipulation
- Dummy node technique for easier edge case handling
- In-place reversal and modification
- Cycle detection and removal
