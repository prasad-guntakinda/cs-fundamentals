# Linked List Interview Preparation Guide

## Key Concepts to Learn
- Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List
- Node structure and pointer manipulation
- Traversal, insertion, deletion (at head, tail, kth position)
- Reversal of linked list (iterative and recursive)
- Detecting and removing cycles (Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare)
- Finding middle node (slow/fast pointer)
- Merging two sorted linked lists
- Intersection of two linked lists
- Palindrome check in linked list
- Copying a linked list with random pointers
- Sorting a linked list (merge sort)
- Linked list as stack/queue implementation

## Patterns to Master
- Two-pointer (slow/fast, runner technique)
- Recursion for list manipulation
- Dummy node technique for easier edge case handling
- In-place reversal and modification
- Cycle detection and removal

## Common Interview Questions

### Easy
1. Reverse a linked list (iterative)
2. Find the middle node of a linked list
3. Merge two sorted linked lists
4. Remove nth node from end of list
5. Find kth node from end
6. Traversal, insertion, deletion (basic operations)
7. Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list

### Medium
8. Reverse a linked list (recursive)
9. Detect a cycle in a linked list
10. Find the starting node of a cycle
11. Find intersection point of two linked lists
12. Check if a linked list is a palindrome
13. Delete a node given only access to that node
14. Rotate a linked list by k places
15. Partition a linked list around a value
16. Swap nodes in pairs
17. Group odd and even nodes together
18. Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
19. Add two numbers represented by linked lists

### Hard
20. Sort a linked list (merge sort)
21. Flatten a multilevel linked list
22. Copy a linked list with random pointers
23. Implement LRU cache using linked list

## Advanced/Follow-up Questions
- Design a linked list class with all operations (insert, delete, search, etc.)
- Implement a doubly linked list and explain use cases
- Convert a binary tree to a doubly linked list
- Implement a skip list
