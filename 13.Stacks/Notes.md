#### When to use Stacks in problems?
- Balalnced Pare, If you feel, any two adjacent characters to be ruled out then we can use Stacks
- Examples:
  - If both the characters are same we want to cancel each other Ex question: Double Character Trouble- `abbaaccd`
  - If adjacent compliments needs to be cancelled out Ex question: Balanced Parentheses- `( [{()}])`
  - Expression Evaluation: Infix to Postfix, Infix to Prefix, Postfix to solution ... etc
  - Nearest Smaller/greater element in the left or right side of the array always think of Stacks
