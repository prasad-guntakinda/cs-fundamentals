# two-pointer technique

###### 1
- The two-pointer technique is a pattern in which two pointers iterate across the data structure until one or both of them satisfy the necessary condition.
- **Suitable Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists

### Common patterns in the two-pointer approach:
            
#### 1. One pointer starts from beginning and other starts from end, they move towards each other until they both meet.

**Example Problems:**
1. Reverse the characters in a string
2. Reverse an array or part of an array
3. Rotate array `K` times



#### 2. One pointer moves at a slow pace while the other pointer moves at a faster pace.

**Example Problems:**
1. Remove duplicates from a sorted array
2. 
3. 

## When to Use ?
1. Whenever problem involves with reverse or rotation
2. Whenever you are looping through array multiple times
3. Middle element in the linked list
4.

### Sample Questions Explanations:

#### 1. Reverse an array:
- Here we start two pointers one is from i=0  and another from j=n-1
- we swap (0,n-1) and we increment i++ and decrement j-- until they meet
- **how do we know whether both pointers are met or not?**
- if array size `n is odd` then `i==j` otherwise first pointer crosses second pointer `i>j`

**Pseudo Code**
```java
public int[] reverseAnArray(int[] arr){
    int n = arr.length;
    int i=0;
    int j=n-1;
// swap elements until both pointers meet.
// below loop will be stopped either i==j or i>j        
    while(i<j){
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
        i++;
        j--;
    }
   return arr; 
}

```
#### 2. Valid Palindrome
- A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards
- Examples: 
            
            - Words: "Level", "madam", "racecar"
            - Numbers: 22, 1234321, 2002
            - Dates and times: 12/21/33 12:21
            - Sentences: "Adam, I'm Ada!", "Ma is as selfless as I am", "Poor Dan is in a droop", "Leon sees Noel"
**Pseudo Code:**
1. **Brute-force:** 
   - Convert current string to char array
   - iterate over each char and store it int the new array
   - compare each index char is same or not. it all indexes are same then it is `palindrome`
2. **Optimization:**
  - use two-pointer approach first pointer start from `i=0` and another from `j=n-1` move towards opposite direction
  - compare `str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(j)` if both chars are same then `i++` and `j--`, otherwise return given string is not palindrome

```java
//    str = 'abcdedcba';
public static boolean isPalindrome(String str){
    int n=str.length();
    int i=0;
    int j=n-1;
    while(i<j){
        if(str.charAt(i) == str.charAt(j)){
            i++;
            j--;
        }else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### 3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- For Example, we have an array `[1,1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5]`
- if you start `i=0`, `j=1` and compare `arr[i] == arr[j]` means it is a duplicate
- if it is duplicate then ignore otherwise, add unique number to `i+1`<sup>th</sup> index
- iterate until `j` reaches to end of the array
- return `Arrays.copyOfRange(arr,0,i+1)`

```java
public static int[] removeDupsFromSortedArray(int[] arr){
    if(arr.length ==0 || arr.length ==1){
        return arr;
    }
    int n=arr.length;
    int i=0; // first-pointer which is holding unique element's index
    int j=1; // second-pointer which iterates the array and find the duplicates
    while(j<n){
        if(arr[i] != arr[j]){
            arr[++i] = arr[j];
        }
        j++;
    }
    return Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, 0, i+1);    
}

```
