<summary>Q1. Find the frequency of the element K </summary>

__problem statement:__

```text
Given a sorted array, find the frequency of an element K.
```
__Approach:__
```text
- As an array is sorted all the duplicate elements will be next to each other
- So find the first occurrence of the element K and then find last occurrence of the element K
- Once you have the boundaries [l,r] = r-l+1 // No of elements in an closed interval [a, b] = b-a+1 
```

<summary>Q1. Sorted Insert Position  </summary>

__problem statement:__

```text
You are given a sorted array A of size N and a target value B.
Your task is to find the index (0-based indexing) of the target value in the array.

If the target value is present, return its index.
If the target value is not found, return the index of least element greater than equal to B.
If the target value is not found and least number greater than equal to target is also not present, return the length of array (i.e. the position where target can be placed)
Your solution should have a time complexity of O(log(N)).
